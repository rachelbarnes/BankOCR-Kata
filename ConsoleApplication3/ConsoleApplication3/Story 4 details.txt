It turns out that often when a number comes back as ERR or ILL 
it is because the scanner has failed to pick up 
on one pipe or underscore for one of the figures. For example
    _  _  _  _  _  _     _ 
|_||_|| || ||_   |  |  ||_ 
  | _||_||_||_|  |  |  | _| 

The 9 could be an 8 if the scanner had missed one 
Or the 0 could be an 8. 
Or the 1 could be a 7. 
The 5 could be a 9 or 6. 
So your next task is to look at numbers that have come back as ERR or ILL, 
and try to guess what they should be, 
by adding or removing just one pipe or underscore. 
If there is only one possible number with a valid checksum, then use that. 
If there are several options, the status should be AMB. 
If you still can't work out what it should be, the status should be reported ILL.

1.create an if() that will determine if the checksum.checkvalidity(accountNumber) gives an
illegible number or an error as positive.
2. if it does come back as an error or an illegitimate number, then guess what the number should be. 
3.check that number against the checksum.checkvalidity(accountNumber) checker to determine if it 
is valid; if it is not valid, then keep check again. 
4.if there are several options that are several options that come back to guesses that are valid,
print the number with + " AMB" next to it. 
5.If the number still cannot be determined after the testings, print the number + " ILL".
